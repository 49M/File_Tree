File tree map visualizer

Here is a video demonstrating the functionality of the file map visualizer application which I created as a school project.

What problem does this application solve?
- Managing folders and files is often tedious and not very user-friendly
- Makes it easier to see folder/file sizes as they compare to other items within directories
- Simplifies movement and file deletion
